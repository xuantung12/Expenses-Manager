# Expense Tracker

An expense tracker mobile application using Android Studio in Java.

## Introduction
As college students who always live on a tight budget, we are thinking about how to optimize every penny we spend. 
Of course, google spread sheet is a nice tool to write down all our expenses and calculate the balance. 
However, with a handy useful app on your smartphone which is always around you, it will be easier and way more convenient to record and track your expenses.

## Feature Specifications
- Main Page

The pie chart we use at the main page of the app shows the percentage of each category under the time period chosen. 
While clicking on the icon of the category, if there are some expenses and incomes under this category, it will show the total amount of cost.
